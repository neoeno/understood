## Understood

I think this is going to be a series of projects for makers to learn to code. I
probably won't ever finish it but it's a container for something

It's only a starting point — enough to get you going.

Each folder will contain a file called `index`. Open that and read.

You'll also need a text editor. I recommend [Atom](http://atom.io/).
