      This bit between <head> and </head> is called the header.
      It isn't displayed. It tells the browser some things about the document.
      It is also where you might find styling (CSS) and scripting (Javascript).

      This tag is called the title tag.
      It sets the title of the document.
      It is usually seen as the text in the tab bar.
      It is mandatory.

  <body>
    
    <!--
      This bit between <body> and </body> is called the body.
      It is also an element. You'll learn more about those.
      You can think of it what the browsers displays.
      For example:
    -->

    Hello, World!

    <!--
      The text 'Hello, World!' is displayed by the browser.
      But this text isn't.
      This text is a comment.
      Comments are secret messages that only developers see.
      Each language has its own way of denoting comments.
      I'm sure you can work out how HTML does this.
    -->

    One important thing to know about HTML is that it is does not preserve
    whitespace.

    What does that mean? Open this file in your browser and you'll notice that
    it's all one big paragraph. Often, that's not what you want.

    HTML treats any sequence of 'spaces' (known as whitespace) as if it were
    just one space character. Whitespace also includes new lines and tabs.

    <p>So if you want to create a new paragraph, you have to do this.</p>

    <p>
      The 'p' stands for paragraph. This tells the browser to create a
      paragraph element. What's an element? That's a difficult question, so I
      wouldn't worry about it for now.
    </p>

    <p>
      One great thing about the way HTML treats whitespace is that you can lay
      out your HTML however you like, and you'll still get the same result. You
      will notice that I'm breaking up my paragraphs into lines of around 80
      characters to keep my source code readable. But the browser will still
      use all the space it has available.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most important things to keep in mind when writing code is to
      make it easy to read. It takes a while to learn how to do this, but keep
      it in mind.

      When you come across a tag you don't know, you can look it up. One of the
      best references for HTML is Mozilla Developer Network. It's by the same
      people that make Firefox.

      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">
        Here is a list of HTML elements.
      </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of it might not make sense to you immediately, but it's still worth
      reading, for the same reason you might read something you don't understand
      when learning a new language. It gets you accustomed to the language. You
      can always google terms you don't know to see if you can figure them out.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should experiment. Change anything you like, try to break it and see
      what happens. It's actually very important to break things, because even
      the most experienced developers break things many times each day. If you
      can recognise what a broken thing looks like, you'll be better prepared
      when you encounter it unexpectedly.

    <p>Here is some HTML for you to play with:</p>

    <h3>Bananas</h3>
